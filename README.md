# Loyalty Systems Series  
### Applied loyalty architecture, simulations, and system design

This series collects my work on loyalty systems, platform design, governance, and data integrity.  
It includes writing, diagrams, and small technical projects that demonstrate how loyalty infrastructure behaves beneath the UI layer.

My goal is to make loyalty design legible — not as marketing, but as a distributed systems problem involving events, FX, tiering, reconciliation, and truth stability at scale.

## 🧪 Projects (In Progress)

These projects each have their own repo and contribute to the broader loyalty portfolio.

### • Loyalty Points Simulator  
*A small interactive tool to simulate earning, redemption, FX, and partner tiers.*  
Repo: _(coming soon)_

### • Event Contract Validator — Loyalty Edition  
*A lightweight validator that checks event quality, naming consistency, and schema drift.*  
Repo: _(coming soon)_

### • ML Drift Dashboard — Points & Promotions  
*A tiny dashboard showing how inconsistent loyalty data creates drift in downstream models.*  
Repo: _(coming soon)_

## 🗺️ System Diagrams  
These diagrams illustrate how loyalty systems behave behind the scenes.

- Earn → Ledger → Redeem Event Flow  
- Points Truth Drift Map  
- FX Conversion and Tiered Value Reconciliation  
- Partner-Specific Rules and Multi-Market Drift  

(Diagrams will be added as the series grows.)

## 🎯 Purpose of This Series  
Loyalty systems are often framed as marketing features, but in practice they are:

- distributed systems  
- dependent on clean events  
- sensitive to FX timing  
- vulnerable to drift  
- deeply tied to governance  
- mirrors of a company’s truth architecture  

This series translates that complexity into practical, small artifacts for PMs, engineers, and data teams.

## 🧩 About This Repo  
This repository is the **central hub** for all loyalty-related work — writing, diagrams, prototypes, and system investigations.  
It will grow gradually and intentionally, one small artifact at a time.
